  Target butler is an archery-related project that tries to 'read' the arrow score based on sound and vibration sensor readouts.
  4 sensors (microphones) are surrounding the target itself, each of the 4 channels are amplified and the resulting signal passes thru an envelope-detection circuit. the 4 ADC values are read at a ~1ms interval by the uC.
  power is either from a 2Ah LiPo accu, any random 5V source or a solar panel.
